## Hey there, I'm Tanish!

I'm a junior at Brown University; right now, my biggest CS interests are computer graphics, database systems, and deep learning. In my spare time on holidays, I'm also an avid astrophotographer âœ¨. You can find out more about me on my personal website, [tanishmakadia.com](https://tanishmakadia.com).
